\class dmz::EventModule
\ingroup Event
\brief Event module interface.
\details The event module is a runtime database that stores attributes of
events. These events may have been generated locally or remotely.
Each event may have multiple attributes of the same type. For example an event
may have a source object and a target object.
An attribute handle is used to access the different attributes of a given type.
The event module supports both a push model for creating and closing events and a
pull model for attribute updates. The
lookup_* functions may be used to pull object attributes from the object module.
An event observer is used to push when an event is created and closed.
An event observer is registered with the event module and
may subscribe to event create and/or close. After registration, the object observer
will be notified whenever an event is created or closed.
Attribute handles are what allow multiple values to be stored in one
attribute. 
The default attribute handle is defined by the String variable
dmz::EventAttributeDefaultName.
The source attributes handle is defined by the String variable
dmz::EventAttributeSourceName.
The target attributes handle is defined by the String variable
dmz::EventAttributeTargetName.
The munitions attributes handle is defined by the String variable
dmz::EventAttributeMunitionsName.
Attribute handles are named handles allocated by the runtime.
Since attribute handles are runtime allocated, the
attribute handle value should never be hard coded as it mostly like be a different
number from run to run.
Zero is considered an invalid attribute handle.
An event's attributes can \b not be updated after the event has been closed.

\fn dmz::EventModule * dmz::EventModule::cast (

the EventModule interface of the Plugin is returned.
\param[in] PluginPtr Pointer to the Plugin to cast.
\param[in] PluginName String containing the name of the desired EventModule.

\fn dmz::Boolean dmz::EventModule::register_event_observer (
const EventType &Type,
const Mask &CallbackMask,
EventObserver &observer)
\brief Registers event observer.

\brief Release an event observer.

in the \a CallbackMask. If an observer has subscribed to create and close
callbacks and the CallbackMask only contains the create bit, the observer will
continue to receive close callbacks.
\param[in] Type EventType to register for callbacks.
\param[in] CallbackMask Mask containing the callbacks desired for subscription.
\param[in] observer EventObserver to register.
\return Returns dmz::True if the event observer was successfully registered.

creation fails.

\fn dmz::Boolean dmz::EventModule::close_event (const Handle EventHandle)
\brief Closes an open event.

causes both the create and close callbacks to be called. The create callback is made
before the event is actually closed so that the event may be modified. If the event
is closed from with in a create or close callback from a different event, the close
is cached and performed after the current event is completely closed and all its
callbacks have been made.
